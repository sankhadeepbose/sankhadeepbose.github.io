About Me
======
Hello, I am Sankhadeep (শঙ্খদীপ, pronounced /ʃɔŋ.kʰoː.d̪iːp/<audio id="pronunciation" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/audio/pronunciation.mp3"></audio>
<button onclick="document.getElementById('pronunciation').play()" style="background:none;border:none;padding:0;margin-left:1px;vertical-align:middle;display:inline;">

</button>), a PhD candidate at [Vellore Institute of Technology](https://vit.ac.in/), India; specializing in *[Thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics)*, *[Statistical Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics)*, and *[Atomistic Simulation](http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/Computer_simulation_techniques)*. I hold a Master's degree in Nanotechnology and a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. 

I'm part of a collaborative research group working alongside [Dr. Bruno D'Aguanno](https://sites.google.com/view/brunodaguanno) (*University of Lincoln, UK*), [Dr. Andrea Floris](https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/afloris) (*University of Lincoln, UK*), and [Dr. Erminia Leonardi](https://www.crs4.it/en/people/erminia-leonardi/) (*CRS4, Italy*). Our research aims to advance the knowledge of non-homogeneous thermodynamic systems, phase transitions in finite systems, and cross-interactions in nanofluids.

Research Interests
======
My research interests are focused on the following areas:
1. **Thermodynamics of Real Systems**: I have been investigating how real, nonhomogeneous systems reach thermodynamic equilibrium. Using classical Molecular Dynamics, I analyze how these systems, from nanometer to macroscopic scales, reach equilibrium states governed by spatial variations in intensive variables. This research challenges [standard equilibrium thermodynamics](https://archive.org/details/herbert-b.-callen-thermodynamics-and-an-introduction-to-thermostatistics-wiley-1985_202201) as these intensive variables diverge from predictions for infinitely large ideal systems. Surface and boundary effects play a significant role than previously recognized.
1. **Phase Transitions of Finite Systems**: I also study the first-order phase transitions of finite systems, primarily examining how these transitions are influenced by surface interactions. Using atomistic simulations, I analyze the dynamics of these systems to understand their behavior.
