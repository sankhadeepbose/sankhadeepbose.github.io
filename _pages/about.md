About Me
======
Hello, I am Sankhadeep (শঙ্খদীপ, pronounced /ʃɔŋ.kʰoː.d̪iːp/<audio id="pronunciation" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/audio/pronunciation.mp3"></audio>
<button onclick="document.getElementById('pronunciation').play()" style="background:none;border:none;padding:0;margin-left:1px;vertical-align:middle;display:inline;">

</button>), a PhD student at the [Vellore Institute of Technology](https://vit.ac.in/), India; specializing in *[Thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics)*, *[Statistical Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics)*, and *[Atomistic Simulation](http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/Computer_simulation_techniques)*. I hold a Master's degree in Nanotechnology and a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. With renowned researchers like [Dr. Bruno D'Aguanno](https://sites.google.com/view/brunodaguanno) (*University of Lincoln, UK*), [Dr. Andrea Floris](https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/afloris) (*University of Lincoln, UK*), and [Dr. Erminia Leonardi](https://www.crs4.it/peopledetails/ermy/leonardi-erminia/) (*CRS4, Italy*), I work in a dynamic and stimulating research environment, exploring the thermodynamics of real materials, trying to figure out what makes them tick (and sometimes why they refuse to). These collaborations have significantly shaped my research approach, providing diverse perspectives and the continuous pursuit of knowledge.

Research Interests
======
My research interests are focused on the following areas:
1. **Thermodynamics of Real Systems**: My recent work investigates the thermodynamic equilibrium mechanisms of real non-homogeneous systems. Using classical Molecular Dynamics, I analyze how these systems, from nanometer to macroscopic scales, reach equilibrium states governed by spatial variations in intensive variables. This research challenges conventional thermodynamics by showing that intensive variables diverge from predictions for infinitely large ideal systems, highlighting the significant role of surface and boundary effects.
1. **Phase Transitions of Finite Systems**: I study the first-order phase transitions of finite systems, primarily examining how these transitions are influenced by surface interactions. Through atomistic simulations, I aim to uncover the intricate dynamics and behaviors of these systems.
1. **Cross-interaction in Nanofluids**: Another area of my research involves looking into the interactions between nanoparticles in nanofluids. I explore how these interactions affect the stability and thermal properties of nanofluids. This research includes understanding the specific heat behavior and colloidal stability, which is crucial for optimizing thermal energy storage technologies and other industrial applications.
