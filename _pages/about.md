About Me
======
Hello, I am Sankhadeep (শঙ্খদীপ, pronounced /ʃɔŋ.kʰoː.d̪iːp/<audio id="pronunciation" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/audio/pronunciation.mp3"></audio>
<button onclick="document.getElementById('pronunciation').play()" style="background:none;border:none;padding:0;margin-left:1px;vertical-align:middle;display:inline;">

</button>), a PhD candidate at the [Vellore Institute of Technology](https://vit.ac.in/), India; specializing in *[Thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics)*, *[Statistical Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics)*, and *[Atomistic Simulation](http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/Computer_simulation_techniques)*. I hold a Master's degree in Nanotechnology and a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. I am part of a collaborative research group with [Dr. Bruno D'Aguanno](https://sites.google.com/view/brunodaguanno) (*University of Lincoln, UK*), [Dr. Andrea Floris](https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/afloris) (*University of Lincoln, UK*), and [Dr. Erminia Leonardi](https://www.crs4.it/peopledetails/ermy/leonardi-erminia/) (*CRS4, Italy*). Together, we investigate non-homogeneous thermodynamic systems, phase transitions in finite systems, and cross-interactions in nanofluids with a focus on advancing our understanding of real material behaviors under various conditions.

Research Interests
======
My research interests are focused on the following areas:
1. **Thermodynamics of Real Systems**: In my recent work, I have been investigating how real, nonhomogeneous systems reach thermodynamic equilibrium. Using classical Molecular Dynamics, I analyze how these systems, from nanometer to macroscopic scales, reach equilibrium states governed by spatial variations in intensive variables. This research challenges [standard equilibrium thermodynamics](https://archive.org/details/herbert-b.-callen-thermodynamics-and-an-introduction-to-thermostatistics-wiley-1985_202201) as these intensive variables diverge from predictions for infinitely large ideal systems. Surface and boundary effects play a significantly more important role than previously recognized.
1. **Phase Transitions of Finite Systems**: I study the first-order phase transitions of finite systems, primarily examining how these transitions are influenced by surface interactions. Using atomistic simulations, I analyze the dynamics of these systems to understand their behavior.
1. **Cross-interaction in Nanofluids**: I investigate the interactions between nanoparticles in nanofluids and how these interactions influence the fluids' stability and thermal properties. My research involves analyzing specific heat behavior and colloidal stability, which are critical for optimizing thermal energy storage technologies and other industrial applications.
